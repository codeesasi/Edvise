# Enhanced AI and Machine Learning Implementation Plan for Edvise

## Executive Summary

Edvise aims to democratize quality education through personalized learning experiences. This enhanced plan outlines the implementation of cutting-edge AI/ML technologies to create an intelligent educational advisory platform that adapts to individual learning styles, connects students with optimal resources, and provides data-driven insights for continuous improvement. Our updated strategy incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), AI Agents, and model fine-tuning to deliver state-of-the-art personalized education experiences.

## Current Codebase Analysis

The current Edvise application is a Flask-based web application that:
1. Monitors the clipboard for URLs
2. Extracts metadata (title, thumbnail) from web pages
3. Stores this information in a PostgreSQL database
4. Provides a web interface for managing saved URLs

**Enhancement Opportunities Identified:**
- Limited content understanding beyond basic metadata
- No personalization or user profiling
- Lacks intelligent organization and discovery features
- Missing educational-specific analysis capabilities
- Opportunity to leverage generative AI for content creation and enhancement
- Need for more interactive and autonomous learning assistance
